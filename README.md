# Friends-Graph
In this project the methods work similar to Facebook's mutual friends system by matching people of similar universities and shortest paths.

A Graph of names with their respective University is inputted, the methods then determine which names would most likely know each other by using shortest path and their respective university's. Breadth first search is also implemented to find the "connectors" within the graph, which are people who link two groups of people.
